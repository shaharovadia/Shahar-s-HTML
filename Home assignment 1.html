    <div class="text">
        <div id="description" >
        
         <p> The avocado! A creamy, delicious fruit (yes, it's a fruit!) that has taken the world by storm.
            The avocado (Persea americana) is a medium-sized, evergreen tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae). 
            It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated in Mesoamerica more than 5,000 years ago.
            Then as now it was prized for its large and unusually oily fruit. The tree likely 
            originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala.Its fruit, 
            sometimes also referred to as an alligator pear or avocado pear, is botanically a large berry containing a 
            single large seed. Sequencing of its genome showed that the evolution of avocados was shaped by polyploidy 
            events and that commercial varieties have an hybrid origin.Avocado trees are partly 
            self-pollinating,
            and are often propagated through grafting to maintain consistent fruit output. 
            Avocados are presently 
            cultivated in the tropical and Mediterranean climates of many countries.

    <h1 style="padding:15px; font-size: 40px;"> Avocado's History</h1>
    <div id="history" class="text">
        
     <p >Domestication, leading to genetically distinct cultivars, possibly originated in the    Tehuacan Valley in the
         state of Puebla, Mexico.There is evidence for three possible separate domestications of the avocado, 
         resulting in the currently recognized Guatemalan (quilaoacatl), Mexican (aoacatl) and West Indian 
         (tlacacolaocatl) landraces. The Guatemalan and Mexican and landraces originated in the highlands of those 
         countries, while the West Indian landrace is a lowland variety that ranges from Guatemala, Costa Rica, 
         Colombia, Ecuador to Peru, achieving a wide range through human agency before the arrival of the Europeans.
         The three separate landraces were most likely to have already intermingled[a] in pre-Columbian America and 
         were described in the Florentine Codex.

    <div class="text" id="healthbenefits">
        
        <p>The mighty avocado, more than just a toast topping, is a nutritional powerhouse brimming with 
        health benefits. This creamy green fruit, technically a berry, packs a punch of good fats, fiber, 
        and essential vitamins and minerals, making it a superstar for your well-being.
        Firstly, avocados are loaded with monounsaturated fats, specifically oleic acid, the same healthy fat 
        found in olive oil. These fats help lower bad cholesterol (LDL) while raising good cholesterol (HDL), 
        reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Additionally, avocados are high in fiber, which keeps you 
        feeling fuller for longer and aids in digestion.Avocados are also a treasure trove of vitamins and minerals. 
        They're a great source of vitamin E, a potent antioxidant that protects cells from damage and may reduce the risk of certain cancers.
